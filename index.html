<h1>Hi There</h1>
<p>My name is Melany Barros and I am currently an incoming senior in the Academy of Finance and Enterprise. I am part of an Academic program known as SEO, Seizing Every Opportunity, that allows low income students to recieve equal educational opportunities as high income students. This program has allowed me to gain a growth mindset and become aware of the obstacles that are still  being confronted today, in society.</p>p>
